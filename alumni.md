# Git 101 Alumni

This file serves two functions: 

1. It's a list of people who've taken this course
2. It's a file to practice making changes to and resolving conflicts on. 

Participants should add their name and a link to their resume below. The
markdown syntax for creating a link is: 

	[display text](http://example.com)

Preface this with a `*` to make it an entry in a bullet list. Yours should look
like 

	* [My Name](http://example.com/my_resume)
